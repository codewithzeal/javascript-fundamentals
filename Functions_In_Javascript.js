/*
Parameters are essentially passed to functions by value â€” so if the code within the 
body of a function  assigns a completely new value to a parameter that was passed to the 
function, the change is not reflected globally or in the code which called that function.

When you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the object's properties, 
that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:
 */

function myFunc(theObject) {
  theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}

const mycar = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Accord',
  year: 1998,
};

// x gets the value "Honda"
const x = mycar.make;

// the make property is changed by the function
myFunc(mycar);
// y gets the value "Toyota"
const y = mycar.make;

/*   
  When you pass an array as a parameter, if the function changes any of the array's 
  values,  that change is visible outside the function, 
  as shown in the following example: */

function myFunc1(theArr) {
  theArr[0] = 30;
}

const arr = [45];

console.log(arr[0]); // 45
myFunc1(arr);
console.log(arr[0]); // 30

//Arguments object
/*
1. The arguments of a function are maintained in an array-like object. 
Within a function, you can address the arguments passed to it as follows:
2. where i is the ordinal number of the argument, starting at 0. 
So, the first argument passed to a function would be arguments[0]. 
The total number of arguments is indicated by arguments.length.
3. Using the arguments object, you can call a function with more 
arguments than it is formally declared to accept. This is often useful if you 
don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function. 
You can use arguments.length to determine the number of 
arguments actually passed to the function, and then access 
each argument using the arguments object.

For example, 
consider a function that concatenates several strings. 
The only formal argument for the function is a string that 
specifies the characters that separate the items to concatenate. 
The function is defined as follows:
*/


function myConcat(separator) {
  let result = ''; // initialize list
  // iterate through arguments
  for (let i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    result += arguments[i] + separator;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(myConcat(', ', 'red', 'orange', 'blue'))
